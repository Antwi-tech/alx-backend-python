Certainly! Here's a **simple and clear README** for your test of the `access_nested_map` function. You can save this as `README.md` in your project folder.

# access_nested_map Unit Tests

This project contains unit tests for the `access_nested_map` function found in `utils.py`.

## 📌 Description

The `access_nested_map` function safely retrieves values from a nested Python dictionary using a path of keys (provided as a list or tuple).

### Example:
```python
nested_map = {"a": {"b": {"c": 42}}}
access_nested_map(nested_map, ["a", "b", "c"])  # Returns: 42
````

---

## 🧪 Tests

The test file `test_util.py` uses Python’s `unittest` framework along with the `parameterized` library to test multiple cases of the `access_nested_map` function.

### Tested Scenarios:

* Accessing a single-level key
* Accessing nested keys
* Returning a dictionary or final value based on key path

### Example Test Case:

```python
@parameterized.expand([
    ({"a": 1}, ("a",), 1),
    ({"a": {"b": 2}}, ("a",), {"b": 2}),
    ({"a": {"b": 2}}, ("a", "b"), 2),
])
```

## ✅ How to Run Tests

Make sure you have `parameterized` installed:

```bash
pip install parameterized
```

Then run the tests using:

```bash
python3 test_util.py
```

You should see:

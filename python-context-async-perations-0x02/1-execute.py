        """
        Hereâ€™s how you can implement a reusable class-based context manager named ExecuteQuery that:

Takes a SQL query and optional parameters.

Opens the database connection.

Executes the query with parameters.

Returns the result.

Automatically handles connection and cursor cleanup using __enter__() and __exit__().

 Key Notes:
params is passed as a tuple to prevent SQL injection and support parameterized queries.

results is fetched and returned from __enter__(), making the context block simple and clean.

Proper cleanup is handled in __exit__() whether or not an error occurs.
